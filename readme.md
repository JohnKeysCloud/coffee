# cloud 8 caf√© ‚òïÔ∏èüí≠

A coffee shop website, built for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>. The purpose of this project was to learn how to use **Webpack** to bundle JavaScript modules, handle asset management, compile SASS styles to CSS & various other **NPM** packages. 

I designed and authored this project using using JavaScript, CSS, SCSS and EJS for templating.

### Notes
The content of the page is generated dynamically through the use of JavaScript modules. This allowed me to create a single page application that is easy to maintain and update.

All of the images on the site were AI generated using Midjourney.

I hope you like it! ^_^
